      Traditional Websites Were Built To Exist.

      Most websites are digital brochures.
      They look nice, but they don’t automate sales.
      They don’t capture abandoned orders.
      They don’t guide customers through checkout.
      And they don’t integrate with payment systems properly.

    <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-stone-600">
      In a world where attention is short and competition is high,
      your business needs more than a website.
      It needs a revenue engine.
